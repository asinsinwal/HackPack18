Chrome Extension Project

## Watch Your Time

Watch your time is a lightweight chrome extension that allows user to view the amount of time they spend on Netflix, Youtube, Web.Whatsapp and facebook.

It maintains a time record for all of the above website and logs on console about the time one spent on these websites in a day.
As a day changes the time is reset.

The project can be extended to allow the user to feed in the websites that they want to track.
A pop up can be created to prettify the time outputs.
